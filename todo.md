- [ ] Optimize for speed iteration 2
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Inner grid always squared
- [ ] when the component is in linear mode, only 4 corner points should be visible ( center control points and bezier handles could be hidden)
- [ ] when you switch from linear to bezier mode, the grid handles should align/reset to „default state“
- [ ] could you please add two additional handles to the linear mode like this - one that would move the whole patch around while the other would rotate the patch
- [ ] can we change the zooming behavior, so the component zooms to the cursor position and not the canvas center (for example like the google maps)
- [ ] could we set the pan boundaries
