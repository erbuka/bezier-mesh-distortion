# TODO

- [X] ~~*Improve algorithm*~~ [2019-10-01]
- [X] ~~*Extract the bezier patch as a class*~~ [2019-10-01]
- [X] ~~*Remove link handles functionality and use the mouse button instead*~~ [2019-10-01]
- [X] ~~*Create control point dom elements at run time*~~ [2019-10-01]
- [X] ~~*Move tool*~~ [2019-10-08]
- [X] ~~*Cut tool*~~ [2019-10-08]
- [X] ~~*Align points functions*~~ [2019-10-09]
- [X] ~~*Zooming*~~ [2019-10-09]
- [X] ~~*Panning*~~ [2019-11-07]
- [X] ~~*Color refactoring*~~ [2019-10-09]
- [X] ~~*Optimize for speed iteration 1*~~ [2019-10-09]
- [ ] Optimize for speed iteration 2
    - Reduce style computation (set visible)
- [ ] Update documentation
- [X] ~~*Inner grid always squared*~~ [2019-11-07]
- [X] ~~*when the component is in linear mode, only 4 corner points should be visible ( center control points and bezier handles could be hidden)*~~ [2019-11-09]
- [X] ~~*when you switch from linear to bezier mode, the grid handles should align/reset to „default state“*~~ [2019-11-09]
- [X] ~~*could you please add two additional handles to the linear mode like this - one that would move the whole patch around while the other would rotate the patch*~~ [2019-11-16]
- [X] ~~*can we change the zooming behavior, so the component zooms to the cursor position and not the canvas center (for example like the google maps)*~~ [2019-11-07]
- [X] ~~*could we set the pan boundaries*~~ [2019-11-11]
- [ ] Sensitivity of inner grid points
- [X] ~~*it would be great to add the optional „corners“ property into the component constructor. That way we could customize, where the new patch appears on the canvas. At the moment it’s automatically centered.*~~ [2019-11-14]


## Hours
- Customize inner grid: 0.75
